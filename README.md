# Why?

Every day, 1 million people travel on city transport buses in ahemabad city, many of whom face overcrowded conditions, irregular bus timings, and inconvenient schedules. Women and girls often encounter annoying situations in these crowded environments.

To address these daily challenges, we are enhancing the public transportation experience to encourage more people to use it with the help of technology:

1. Reducing the number of private vehicles on the road.
2. Decreasing air pollutionâ€”comparing 1 bus to 50 private vehicles.
3. Alleviating traffic congestion.
4. Improving overall experience and saving time.
5. Enhancing overall mobility and city planning.

## Overview

This project provides a web-based application to track bus movements, manage passenger information, and visualize collected data. It is focused on improving public transportation and urban mobility, making life easier, reducing air pollution, and alleviating road congestion.

### Features

- **Track Bus Movements**: Simulate the movement of a bus between different stations.
- **Add Passengers**: Record passengers traveling from source to destination stations.
- **Passenger Statistics**: View station-wise passenger counts through interactive charts.
- **Map Display**: Show a map to visualize bus routes.

## Features We're Working On

1. Adding bus details along with driver information.
2. Implementing alerts for unusual situations.
3. Integrating AI and machine learning algorithms to predict passenger behavior trends.
4. Creating an easily accessible and efficient user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery and Chart.js)
- **Maps**: Maps APIs.
